# stylus-relative-loader
A [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) loader for [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack),
with fixed imports.

## vs. stylus-loader

### Relative imports

With `stylus-loader` (which inherits a lot of behavior from Stylus itself),
relative path imports like `./variables` and `./color`, don't necessarily
resolve to the path relative to the file in which the import is found. In fact,
they have the same meaning as just importing `variables` and `color`. This means
the paths are resolved using the Stylus "context" – in effect, you could get the
file at the requested relative path, a file in some ancestor directory, a node
module, or a file that happens to have the same name within another module.

For example:

```
styles
├── a
│   ├── color.styl
│   └── index.styl
├── b
│   ├── color.styl
│   └── index.styl
├── color.styl
└── index.styl
```

Let's say `styles/index.styl` contains:

```stylus
@import './a';
@import './b';
@import './color';
```

...while `a/index.styl` and `b/index.styl` both contain:

```stylus
@import './color';
```

With vanilla `stylus-loader`, the output would be ONLY the contents of
`styles/color.styl`, repeated 3 times. Despite the `./color` imports in `a` and
`b` explicitly calling for `a/color.styl` and `b/color.styl` to be included,
they won't be – merely because another relative path was imported with the
same name.

If you're using very modularized styles (say, some of your imports come from
`node_modules`) this behavior can spell big trouble. You basically have to
ensure that all Stylus filenames in your dependency tree are unique, otherwise
some styles/variables/mixins might go missing!

`stylus-relative-loader` fixes this issue by patching relative imports to all
resolve as if they were full absolute paths. That means you'd get all of
`color.styl`, `a/color.styl`, and `b/color.styl` above.

### Dynamic imports

`stylus-relative-loader` supports dynamic imports, such as those in conditional
branches or with `$variable` interpolation in the path. `stylus-loader` does not
support these and sometimes emits confusing error messages as a result.

This is possible because the static import analysis step in
`stylus-relative-loader` exists purely to increase performance, and is not a
requirement for import resolution like it is in `stylus-loader`. Our general
strategy is to invoke the Stylus renderer, and when any "unresolved" imports are
encountered, we stop rendering, resolved any queued up imports, then try
rendering again from the beginning. This makes `stylus-relative-loader` slower
than `stylus-loader` if you have many dynamic imports, but has the benefit of
correctness. Be careful if you have Stylus plugins with expensive side-effects.

### Status of this fork

There are no doubt people depending on the behavior described above, using it as
a feature, not a bug. We'd love it if this behavior were adopted upstream, as
we don't intend to fully support this fork for a wide audience in the long-term.

## Usage

```js
var css = require('!raw!stylus-relative!./file.styl'); // Just the CSS
var css = require('!css!stylus-relative!./file.styl'); // CSS with processed url(...)s
```

See [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) to see the effect of processed `url(...)`s.

Or within the webpack config:

```js
module: {
  loaders: [{
    test: /\.styl$/,
    loader: 'css-loader!stylus-relative-loader?paths=node_modules/bootstrap-stylus/stylus/'
  }]
}
```

Then you can: `var css = require('./file.styl');`.

Use in tandem with the [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) to add the css rules to your `document`:

```js
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: /\.styl$/, loader: 'style-loader!css-loader!stylus-relative-loader' }
  ]
}
```

and then `require('./file.styl');` will compile and add the CSS to your page.

`stylus-relative-loader` can also take advantage of webpack's resolve options. With the default options it'll find files in `web_modules` as well as `node_modules`, make sure to prefix any lookup in node_modules with `~`. For example if you have a styles package lookup files in it like `@import '~styles/my-styles`. It can also find stylus files without having the extension specified in the `@import` and index files in folders if webpack is configured for stylus's file extension.

```js
module: {
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.styl']
  }
}
```

will let you have an `index.styl` file in your styles package and `require('styles')` or `@import '~styles'` it. It also lets you load a stylus file from a package installed in node_modules or if you add a modulesDirectories, like `modulesDirectories: ['node_modules', 'web_modules', 'bower_components']` option you could load from a folder like bower_components. To load files from a relative path leave off the `~` and `@import 'relative-styles/my-styles';` it.

Be careful though not to use the extensions configuration for two types of in one folder. If a folder has a `index.js` and a `index.styl` and you `@import './that-folder'`, it'll end up importing a javascript file into your stylus.

### Stylus Plugins

You can also use stylus plugins by adding an extra `stylus` section to your `webpack.config.js`.

```js
var stylus_plugin = require('stylus_plugin');
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: /\.styl$/, loader: 'style-loader!css-loader!stylus-relative-loader' }
  ]
},
stylus: {
  use: [stylus_plugin()]
}
```

#### Using nib with stylus

The easiest way of enabling `nib` is to import it in the stylus options:

```js
stylus: {
  use: [require('nib')()],
  import: ['~nib/lib/nib/index.styl']
}
```

where `~` resolves to `node_modules/`

## Install

`npm install stylus-relative-loader stylus --save-dev`

**Important**: in order to have ability use any `stylus` package version,
it won't be installed automatically. So it's required to
add it to `package.json` along with `stylus-relative-loader`.

## Testing

```
npm test
open http://localhost:8080/test/
```
